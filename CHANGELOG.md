# `master`
- Changed default font to monospace in showlibrary (#190)
- Got `rotate!(Accum, ...)` working (#196)

# v0.9.9
- Added a custom docstring extension which allows the Attributes of a Recipe to be shown in
  the help mode (#174).
- Documented a lot of internal features (#174).
- Added a new 3d camera type, `cam3d_cad!`(#161).
- Improved warning text when displaying to text or plotpane (#163).
- Ensured that unless `inline!(true)` was called, plots will always display in
  interactive displays, even in Juno (#163).
- Added licenses for fonts shipped with AbstractPlotting (#160).
- Switched from using system `ffmpeg` to using `FFMPEG.jl` (#160).
- Better docstrings for recording functions (#160).
- Let certain attributes passed to mutating plot functions affect the Scene (#160).
- Changed the default theme for `colorlegend` so that it scales with the resolution of the scene.

  to make the WebGL backend more lightweight (#180).
- Fixed `scale_plot` not actually working (#180).
- Cleaned up theme merging & scene attribute composition, so this works (#180):
    ```julia
    scatter(rand(4), resolution = (200, 200))
    scatter(rand(4), limits = ((0, 0), (200, 200)))
    ```
